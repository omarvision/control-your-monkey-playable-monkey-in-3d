# control-your-monkey-playable-monkey-in-3d
I just decided to have fun and make a monkey in magicavoxel. Find some animations for it in mixamo. And then, move it around in a 3D scene using rigidbody physics. Added a nice little camera follow code and then tried jumping on a box. I wonder if using physics.AddRelativeForce will be more fun than Transform.Translate for moving around?
